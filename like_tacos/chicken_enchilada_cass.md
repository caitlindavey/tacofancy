Chicken Enchilada Casserole 
==============
This is a really great easy dish that serves around 6. Great for families but also saving for just one. It's adapted from [this basic recipe] (http://www.bestofbridge.com/1999/08/01/chicken-enchilada-casserole/). 

Ingredients
-----------
* 3 large flour tortillas
* 1 large onion diced
* 1/2 cup of green onions or garlic greens
* 10oz. can of cream of mushroom soup 284ml
* 2 cups grated cheddar cheese 500ml 
* 2 cups grated mozzarella cheese 500ml
* 1 cup of salsa 250ml (spicy salsa is best as I took out the green chilies in the original recipe)
* 3-4 cups cooked chicken, cut into 1kg of large-ish bite sized pieces

Instructions
------------
Cut each tortilla into 4 or so pieces. Saute onion and green onions (or garlic greens) in oil. Add soup and half the grated cheese. Cook slowly until cheese melts. Linea  buttered 1 1/2 qt. casserole with half the tortilla pieces. Cover with 1/2 cup of salsa. Layer with half the chicken, then half the cheese sauce. Repeat delicious layers. Top with the remaining grated cheese. Bake at 325f for 50-60 minutes. Let stand for about 10mins.
